Designs for printing on 3D printers

![Curved Square Box](./boxes/curved-square-box.scad.png)

I like to write programs and I also like to 3D print. So, one day I found OpenSCAD and that changed my life: I could write *code* and get the code to build stuff on my printer. **Mind blown!!!**

This repository has some of my adventures buliding stuff on my printer, and you can also download and print them yourself. Either use the *.stl* files provided in the repository, or even better, install OpenSCAD and use the *.scad* files to customize before you print!
